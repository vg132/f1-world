<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. Michael, in spite of having improved since this
morning, you're still 1.3 seconds slower than Mika's McLaren. Does that represent the
limit of the car at the moment?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>MS: I wouldn't say it was the limit of the car. We have done
a lot of work for reliability reasons over a Grand Prix distance and in fact we have
struggled to get the performance out of the car. It does have potential, we know that, but
we didn't use it this weekend, for various reasons which we experienced here for the first
time. Going away from here, we obviously know what our next job will be. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. What is the biggest problem with the F399?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>MS: There is no point in talking about it, to be honest. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. Mika, with you and David on the front row again, will
there be another first corner agreement?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>(MH and DC smile at each other) </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>MH (to DC): What do you think? (laughter) </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>DC: Only if I can win this time. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>MH: We'll tell you tomorrow ... maybe. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. Mike, well done. Did you enjoy that?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>DC: More than I did, to be sure ... </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>MH: I can enjoy it now, but at the time when qualifying was
happening, the enjoyment was far away, I have to admit, because before my last lap David
banged in a better time than I did. And when you have only one lap left to get in a time,
it is very rare for it to succeed. You just have to get the right lap, and I did it. It
worked, and I am very happy about it. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. Everyone's lap times seemed to vary during the session.
Were the conditions changing out there a lot?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>MH: No, they didn't change that much, but there were cars
spinning off the circuit which brought dirt on to the surface. It got better and better
all the way to the end, as normal. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. Are you surprised about the gap of almost half a second
to David?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>MH: That same question was asked last year, and I probably
said no. I'll say no again. Although it is a comfortable gap, this is only qualifying.
Tomorrow will count for points. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. Do you have the same feeling this year that you had 12
months ago?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>MH: Yes and no. I obviously feel much more comfortable and
confident with the whole situation, and I definitely feel I am a better driver now than I
was at this time last year. I believe I am performing better than last year. I don't know
how to continue talking about this ... </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. David, did you think you had got pole position safely
in hand?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>DC: I did, but I had to sit and wait. I was a little
surprised that it took Mika so long to go quicker in the session, because of the way we
were running to do many laps rather than using too many sets of tyres. Then it was a
question of getting a good, clean lap. And because I had to keep backing off in the
traffic -- I think it was Johnny [Herbert] I was following for a few laps -- in the end I
had given away too much time to cross the line and start [what should have been] my last
lap. So I didn't complete all my qualifying laps and I would like to think that I was
going to go quicker. Even when I did my 30.9 and saw that Mika was still on 31.0, I
already had the feeling that we hadn't reached the maximum of the car. It was then I got
the bad news that I had run out of time, so I had to come in anyway, to sit and wait. I am
disappointed not to be on the pole. When I look at where we were running when we were
popping the times in, I don't think the gap is a true reflection. Unlike last year, when
the best times were set on the first flying lap with a fresh set of tyres, the more laps
we were doing on the tyres, the quicker they were getting. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. Is this going to be a pattern for the year?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>DC: I don't know, because this is an unusual circuit, being
non-permanent. On the other tracks where there is more rubber laid down I don't expect
qualifying times to be as close to last year's as they have been here. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. What reason would you suggest for so many drivers
having gone off the circuit in the past two days?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>DC: There is less grip available this year, the cars are more
nervous to drive and tyre compounds are pretty hard now. When you just hit a bump and the
car gets sideways, the momentum is enough to take the car off the circuit. We were told
that the idea [behind grooved tyres] was to replicate driving in the rain, but the effect
is completely different from that. It just means that at one moment you can feel quite
stable, but you can go over the limit quite quickly. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. Is this what happened to you when you spun this
afternoon?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>DC: I think I did. I was surprised that I got sideways so
quickly, it was probably because on that lap I was concentrating on keeping the brakes and
tyres warm without going for a complete time. Maybe I just lost concentration slightly,
put a tyre on the grass and spun it. It can be difficult having to change to a T-car that
you haven't used up to that point, so I felt thankful that I was able to drive out of the
gravel without damaging the tyres, and was able to continue running. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. What will be the important factors in the race?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>DC: In any first race it is a combination of things.
Reliability will be one. Strategy is always important, while tyre wear will be different
from last year and we can't use the data we got then. We just need to hope. At the moment
it looks like we have a car advantage and I would be surprised if that disappears when we
go back to running with full fuel, because we were still quick [with high fuel] this
morning and yesterday. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. Michael, you mentioned not being able to get the speed
out of your car that you had hoped for. Are you paying the penalty for the loss of track
time after you stalled on the track yesterday?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>MS: I don't know whether that little amount of lost time
would be enough to prevent us from getting our best performance. </small></font></p>
