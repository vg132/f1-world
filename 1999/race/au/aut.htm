<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. Mika, how do you feel as the first race approaches?</b>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">MH: Personally I am motivated and ready to defend my title.
I am prepared to work hard for it, too. I have learned a lot and developed since last
year, and this year I know where I will be using my energies to win races. By Sunday I
will know a lot more about our performance, but I can certainly say that the effort that
has gone into designing the new car and engine over the winter has been tremendous. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. Michael, what are your feelings?</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">MS: Obviously we feel good. We have put in some good
preparation and used the time very efficiently. Now we are just waiting for practice to
start and looking forward to the race. I feel I can't wait. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. How many miles have you done in the new car?</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">MS: We have certainly done fewer miles than we had done at
this stage last year, but as I said they were done very efficiently. We feel we have done
our homework. But then we felt very well prepared when we got here last year, and we
discovered that we weren't. We just have to wait and see what happens over the weekend. We
should be OK. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. There has been a suggestion that Ferrari may attempt
a full race distance without refuelling. Is that a possibility?</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">MS: As far I know, I think not. Even though the tyres are
harder this year, I doubt whether it would be possible to do it and still have any rubber
left at the end. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. What difference will this year's changes to the tyres
make?</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">MS: Because of the extra fourth groove, obviously the tyres
have had to be made much harder. That means less grip and more sliding. But I have to say
that Bridgestone has done a good job: the tyres don't feel too bad and certainly not as
bad as we expected them to feel. They have done quite a job on developing the four-groove
tyres since I drove the first experimental versions at Suzuka back in November. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. Alessandro, are you pleased to be back in F1?</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">AZ: I wouldn't be here if I hadn't wanted to come back. I
am pleased about it and I am anxious to start. Formula 1 has changed a lot since I left it
in 1995 and it would be quicker to say what has remained the same since then than to list
all the changes. I would say the Champ cars I have driven for the last three years were
closer to the F1 that I used to drive than to the Williams I will be racing here, so it's
a big switch. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable car to drive, with more power than any kind
of road car you can imagine. It's nice to be racing in such a competitive series and I
hope we can put something good together. I have a lot of confidence in the whole
Winfield-Williams operation and I believe that this team, technically speaking, is one of
the greatest ever seen in GP history. That's why I am here. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. In America you gained a reputation for aggressive
driving. Will you bring that aggression to F1?</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">AZ: It depends what you mean by 'aggressive.' A lot of
people say I am aggressive because I kept banging against other drivers. But you don't
finish a lot of races by driving like that. I don't think I am that aggressive. In 1998 I
not only won more points than anyone in CART history but I also completed more miles in
the races than anyone had done before in one season. I just try to take advantage of what
the opportunity is. It's something that Michael and Mika also do very well. When you see
an opportunity and you believe you can outbrake somebody to gain a position, you take it.
You know that you're not being paid to sit there and wait until the following lap. If the
move then works, I wouldn't call that being aggressive. It's just doing your job. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. What comparisons can you draw between this circuit
and Surfers' Paradise?</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">AZ: Considering that this is a non-permanent circuit, this
is most impressive. I have never seen run-off areas as big as the ones they have here --
certainly not in the last three years -- and in Europe I have seen permanent circuits that
are not as good as this one. It seems to be really smooth ... let me tell you tomorrow
whether it's good to race on. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. Ron, what is the mood in the factory?</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">RD: Right now, everyone's very tired. We have had a tough
month. We pushed hard to try to create an advantage over last year's car. We spent some
time making last year's chassis comply with the 1998 rules. That was done as an insurance,
and in the end it was difficult to make a decision on which car to use here. We think we
have brought the faster car, but inevitably -- because it is new -- it is not as reliable
as last year's, although it's pretty good. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. When did you pass the crash test?</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">RD: You don't pass each test on just one day. Instead, you
work through it -- and I believe that most teams have struggled a little bit with some
aspects of this year's tougher tests. The last item we sent for test was the rear impact
structure. Because it is a bolt-on component you can afford to feel a little more relaxed
if it doesn't pass the test first time, and it took us a couple of attempts to pass. But
this is quite normal, because you don't only want to conform with the rules but also be as
competitive as possible. And since the rear crash structure has an aerodynamic influence,
you can find yourself in difficulties as part of the process of making it comply. </font></p>
