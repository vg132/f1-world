<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. Marc, have you enjoyed your
first day of F1 racing? And what are your first impressions of
the Grand Prix scene?</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">MG: I am very happy, first because
I was concerned about how many laps it would take me to learn the
circuit, and it happened a bit quicker than I expected. I was
told beforehand that it took eight or ten laps to find the
braking points and all the right lines, and it was quite
straightforward. I was also concerned to get as many non-stop
laps as possible. It went quite well and I didn't make any
mistakes. I was even quite surprised with my pace, although we
got it wrong with the setup in the second session. F1 is the
biggest circus in the world, as I discovered when I arrived here
on Tuesday. But all 22 drivers are human beings. In the lower
formulas, the media talk about Schumacher, Hill and Hakkinen
almost as though they are divine beings. Obviously they are much
better than me at the moment, but when you see what they are
doing you realise that it is feasible. Maybe it will take two or
three years, but I can do it. So it's a nice feeling to be up
against the best, but it's also a good feeling to know that it
can be done -- with a lot of work. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. Ricardo, what about you?</b>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">RZ: We changed the setup of the
car in the first session and I was also trying to learn the
circuit. I did seven laps in the first session, but I had a
problem with the car in the second and didn't get any laps. They
only just got the car back and they're trying to find the
problem. Although I have driven an F1 car before, I found the
brakes of the BAR very powerful and it was difficult to find the
limit. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. Norbert, what can you tell
us about Mika's accident this afternoon?</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">NH: He just lost it in the corner,
I would say because he was going a bit too quick. The car is
damaged, but we can repair it and I think Mika will be able to
drive it tomorrow. Mika himself is OK. He has no physical
problems. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. With first and second places
today, you must be quite pleased ...</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">NH: As you can see from the TV
screens, our cars looked quite good out on the track, while some
of the others were struggling a bit with the setup. We prepared
ourselves for the race and we have already found quite a good
setup using only one set of tyres per car. I am particularly
pleased for David that he did his best time of the day on old
tyres that already, I think, 29 laps. That shows he is really
fighting and going for it. Mika was on a very quick lap, and he
only just missed it in the final corner. We must not be too
confident, because I am sure that other cars will be able to use
the track better tomorrow when there is more grip. For me, the
gap of 1.6 seconds to Ferrari is just not real. Everybody could
see that they were not on the limit, so I would be happy if it
comes down to 0.6 second or even 0.06 seconds -- as long as we
are in front. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. Congratulations, Hiroshi, on
the great job done by Bridgestone. Your tyres are even quicker
with four grooves this year than they were last year with three!</b>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">HY: This makes a very difficult
issue for us because the FIA asked us for slower tyres this year.
I believe our tyres are slower than last year, but everything
else -- the chassis, aerodynamics, engines and drivers -- are
even better than they were last year, so that is why the lap
times are so much quicker. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. Is this year's compound
really harder than last year?</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">HY: Yes, and it was to be
expected. When we came into F1 with slicks in 1997 we were
running a soft compound. It got harder last year with three
grooves and harder again this year with four. With the limit on
tyres this year, which is down from ten to eight sets per car per
race, we have to be concerned about tyre life. That is another
reason for going to a harder compound. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. Craig, this must have been a
momentous day for you ...</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">CP: It has been an interesting day
and I am very proud of what our team has done. We started from a
green field site less than a year ago and today we are here
racing. We knew we were going to have reliability problems, and
while we have let down one of our drivers a little bit, it has
gone quite well for the other. But we didn't get enough testing
and I don't think this is just an issue for British American
Racing. My opinion is that this will be a race of attrition. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. Would you describe yourself
as totally prepared for this race?</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">CP: No, we are not totally
prepared and I don't think we will be totally ready for Brazil
either. I hope that we will be able to do something by Imola. </font></p>
