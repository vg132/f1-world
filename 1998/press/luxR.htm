<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial"><small>MH=Mika Häkkinen (1'st)</small><br>
<small>MS=Michael Schumacher (2'nd)</small><br>
<small>DC=David Coulthard (3'rd)</small></font></b></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. Congratulations, Mika, on winning your
seventh GP of the season. How does it feel to have taken the lead again in the drivers'
championship?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>MH: Winning this race obviously gives us the advantage in the
championship again. It will also give the team even more motivation to get the car
prepared even better for the final race in Japan. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. After the start, when you were still in third place
behind Eddie Irvine, Michael was disappearing down the road. How worried were you that you
might not be able to catch up the lost time?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>MH: I don't know whether I would use the word 'worried.' In
that situation you have to accept what is happening and maximise your car, your speed and
yourself as you try to gain back the places. If that's not possible, you have to do the
best that you can. I wasn't too worried, I was just pushing. Straight from the start I was
running hard and keeping up the pressure. When Eddie was still leading, at one point he
made a small mistake in the chicane and went wide, which gave Michael the opportunity to
overtake. I think Eddie must have had a problem with his car because when I was running
behind him I could see it all over the place in the corners. That is what allowed me to
overtake him. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. Once Michael came in for his first stop and you took
the lead, your laps times showed that you were pushing extremely hard. How big a risk were
you taking by lapping so quickly?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>MH: It's very strange. When you are driving flat out and
going at your maximum round the corners, you don't think you're taking a risk. You&#146;re
just trying the maximum and putting the car on the limit. You don't think in terms of
taking risks. Everything is very much under control and the only risk comes if something
goes wrong and you will go off. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. Michael, although you started from pole position, you
were beaten away from the line by your team mate Eddie Irvine. Was that part of your
team's plans today?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>MS: No, it wasn't a Ferrari tactic. Going into the first
corner I was slightly behind him and if I had wanted to do so I could have tried to pass
on the outside. But I didn't see any reason because I knew there would be an opportunity
to go ahead of Eddie later on. I just accepted the situation perfectly: Mika was behind me
and, as he said, Eddie made a mistake at the chicane which allowed me to pass him. After
that the situation was nice and good. But at this stage the tyres started to go away a
little bit and I couldn't push as hard as I wanted. Also, the balance wasn't perfectly
right either. We adapted it for the last stint, when the car was a bit better, but it
still wasn't enough. We have to accept that we weren't fast enough in the race. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. After Mika emerged from his first pit stop, still ahead
of you, did Ross Brawn make any changes to the tactics in order to get you back into the
lead after your second stop?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>MS: No, after that the tactics had already been decided. I
was a bit surprised that he had been able to get in front of me, because I had built up a
lead of more than five seconds before I came into the pits. I don't know how many laps
longer Mika stayed out than I had done, but I was believing it would be enough. Even so, I
knew it would be tight. And as you saw, he just took a little bit extra and he got in
front of me. Even if I had kept him behind me at the first stop, there would have been
another chance for him to get by at the second stop. So overall, as I said before, we have
to accept that we weren't fast enough for this race. We now have four or five weeks for
more testing, and we are going to use that. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. You will have to beat Mika by more than four points in
Japan to take the title. What are the things that you can do in these five weeks?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>MS: Just like everyone else involved in this fight, I guess
we have a heavy programme of testing. We are very close and we will try hard. If not, then
still have enough reasons to be very happy about our achievements this year. I believe we
still can be proud of ourselves. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. David, on the grid we noticed that McLaren was putting
a little more fuel in the cars. Was that a late call?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>DC: No, it was always part of our plan to decide what was
happening with the weather before finalising the fuel on the grid. You are only allowed to
add a small amount on the grid, and it wasn't really enough to make any difference. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. How confident were you that the track would stay dry?</b>
</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>DC: The forecast we had said it would be dry. You have to
believe some of the things you hear, so you may as well believe in your own forecaster.
Irrespective of what might have happened later in the race, it was clear that it was dry
at the start. I would certainly not have gone into the race with anything but a dry setup.
</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small><b>Q. Mika, will you be testing, too?</b> </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>MH: Yes, we have testing coming up in Barcelona. Going to
Suzuka, it is obviously going to be interesting. We have had some great fights this year,
and as Michael said we can be proud of our achievements, whatever happens in Japan.
Everyone has done a great job and I am looking forward to it. I would like to add one
thing, which is to thank Mario Illien for what he has done. It is one year ago since David
and I were running comfortably in first and second places at this race -- and we failed.
This year Mercedes and Mario have showed that they can fix problems and be the best. I am
happy it happened here. </small></font></p>
