<p align="left"><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Congratulations, Michael, with the 20th
pole position of your career safely in hand, you have accomplished your mission -- so far.
But you lost some time in practice yesterday, and then some more again this morning with
the hydraulic problem. Do you feel that you haven't had enough time on the track yet?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">MS: It feels like it, yes ... Obviously I know this place
quite well, and the car was handling very well right from the beginning. We have made
certain improvements to the chassis setup. But we have tested so much in recent days that
there is not much to do. We already knew pretty much what we wanted to do, and we achieved
something thanks to what we had already done [in Europe]. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. There has been talk of a special qualifying engine from
Ferrari. What can you tell us about the V10 you used today?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">MS: We have something [extra], but as usual it's only small
things. It's nothing mega and certainly nothing for you to be making big headlines about
tomorrow. I am pretty sure Mercedes does the same. Everybody works very hard. We are quite
happy to have improvements in any area, and it is great to have achieved what we have been
given in only four weeks. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. You look well pleased with this third pole position of
the year. What is Suzuka like to drive in the Ferrari F300?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">MS: I have to say that it is very enjoyable. When you reflect
on what changes have been made to the cars since last year, and then bear in mind that I
am lapping Suzuka almost as fast this year as I did one year ago, it is an incredible
achievement. Most of the improvement comes from the tyres, but it also means a lot of fun
for the drivers. I can say that my car is handling quite nicely. It is really good fun to
be able to throw it around on this circuit. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. The start line here is slightly downhill. Does that
present any difficulties?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">MS: No, in fact it helps you to take off faster! Most of us
have a left foot brake pedal, so we can stop the car on the line without a problem. It was
different in the old days when we had a clutch and brake pedal, it could be tricky. But I
don't expect any difficulties. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Mika, was your last lap going well before you slid off?</b>
</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">MH: Yes, it was. But this is just one of those things that at
the end of the day you don't want to mention. You don't even want to talk about it,
because the lap probably would have been good -- but you never know. It's normal to go off
on the lap that was going to be quick anyway. It doesn't matter too much. I'm a bit upset
for myself, because the car was handling really well at that time. I just went wide a
little bit in that corner, but I did not touch the barrier. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Were you disappointed not to be on pole? It was very
close.</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">MH: Naturally it's disappointing. I prefer to be on pole
position. But it is just not the case, so there is no point to think about it. I'd prefer
myself to be on pole and for David to be second. But it doesn't really give me any
difficulties or aggravation or pressure at all. We will just see what happens tomorrow. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Did you use a qualifying engine today?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">MH: You will have to speak to Mario [Illien] about that. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Was the temperature today ideal for your car and tyres?</b>
</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">MH: Yes. The temperatures in qualifying were just perfect. I
hope the race is more or less the same. The way the car was handling and the tyres were
working in those conditions, it was absolutely ideal. Tonight there will be a meeting with
Bridgestone and they will come with the latest instructions for tomorrow. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. David, we have talked about your problem with
confidence in the car before. What exactly is it that makes this gap between you and Mika?</b>
</font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">DC: I guess I'm just a nervous person! I've spoken about it
much less this year because the car has been much less pitch-sensitive. It was a problem
for me last year and in '96. My driving style tends to be quite aggressive on the brakes,
so if you have a car that is pitch-sensitive, then that's obviously not going to be helped
by that. Here it is not really so much to do with that. When I first hit the track on
Friday I straightaway had a lot understeer: I didn't seem to be able to take the line that
I wanted to. I've improved that a lot. I certainly took a step forward over some of the
other runners who had been ahead of me. Obviously there is still a big gap to the front
row. But I don't think it will be such a big gap in the race. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Will your race be against Eddie Irvine to keep him
behind you?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">DC: No, I've got to be racing to try and chase whoever is in
front. Or maybe I'll make a good start and be leading. So many things can happen at the
start. Okay, I'll let you [Mika] lead! We shouldn't just presume it will be 1-2-3 into the
first corner. It is a tricky entry there. Everyone keeps asking about Eddie and me and
Michael and Mika. But those guys are obviously thinking about each other because they have
a championship at stake. I'm certainly not thinking about Eddie. It makes me feel a bit
queasy when I think about Eddie, actually! So I will just be trying to do the best job I
can for the team this weekend to help McLaren finish the year by [winning] both the
championships.</font></small></p>
