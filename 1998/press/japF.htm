<p><small><font face="Arial">Q. Shinji, is there a chance of you remaining in F1 next
year?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">SN: I don't know yet, because we are still in negotiations.
But I hope so. We should know during November, but I would like to stay with Minardi. I
learned a lot of things in these two years, mainly about how to get along with people.
There are so many differences between the Japanese and western cultures that I was a
little afraid at the beginning of last year. But now I am OK. I know the people who work
in F1 and I am able to work with them and to enjoy my racing. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. What advice would you give to young Japanese drivers
who have the ambition to move up from a junior formula into F1?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">SN: It would be very easy for me to tell a Japanese driver to
learn a European language and to get used to western culture. I would say these are very
important, but also it is advisable for a Japanese driver to come here to learn in
European F3 or F3000, because then they would get experience in those categories. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Tora, is that a valid point? (Q translated) </b></font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">TT: Same opinion. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. So you accept that you should have come to Europe
before F1, to race in F3 or F3000?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">TT: Yes. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Does that mean you have found it very difficult in F1
this year?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">TT: Yes. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. What have you found difficult in F1?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">TT: English. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. And the driving of the car? </b></font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">TT: English is the most important thing. That affects how
fast I can go round a track. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. How much faster would you have been if you spoke
English? </b></font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">TT: Maybe slower. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Mr Honda, what can you tell us about the plans of the
forthcoming Honda factory team in F1?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">HH: My position is very delicate, so I prefer to say No
Comment. You will probably hear something in the near future. Please ask Honda. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Rocco, what are your plans now you are in control at
Benetton Formula?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">RB: I myself arrived at Benetton one year ago. As far as
human resources are concerned, I found a very good team. Technology-wise, we are one of
the most advanced F1 teams: very soon we will have our new wind tunnel, which will be the
top available in F1. In reality, there is nothing revolutionary to be done, it is a
question of optimising the different elements and being well organised. My aim for the
team is to put it in the best possible competitive position. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Your predecessor David Richards wanted to have a major
engine manufacturer as a partner. Do you share that wish?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">RB: Absolutely. This is one thing on which we agreed: the
team needs an engine manufacturer as a partner who shares our targets. Today we have
Renault, which has been a great partner in the past and with whom I am very happy. There
are up s and downs in every relationship, and now Renault has decided, for its own
reasons, that it has to step out of F1. We are supporting the decision 100 per cent, which
is what it means to be a good partner, and we remain open to whatever decision is taken in
the future. We still hope that our relationship will stretch into the future. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Hiroshi-san, looking to the future and the FIA's
requirement of a fourth circumferential groove in the front tyres, how did that idea come
about?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">HY: We have always worked closely with the FIA. We not only
discussed that idea but also another, from the FIA, which involved 20 lateral grooves in
the tyre. Eventually, after more talks, they came to the decision to require the four
circumferential grooves. After this GP we intend to test here at Suzuka in order to see
what effect the extra groove has on tyre performance. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Perry Bell, does Goodyear intend to release all its
contracted teams to allow them to take part in the Bridgestone test starting here on
Tuesday?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">PB: We have issued a letter to all five teams, releasing them
from their contracts with effect from Tuesday. They will therefore be able to test here,
too. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. What's next for Goodyear, then?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">PB: It will be a sad day on Sunday. Then we have to shut down
our British racing operations at Wolverhampton, a process which may stretch to January. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Is there any possibility of a come-back for Goodyear?</b></font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">PB: We certainly hope so. I am sure the management will take
it into consideration, so let's hope it won't be too many years before Goodyear returns to
the sport. </font></small></p>
