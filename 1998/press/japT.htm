<p></b><strong><font face="Arial"><small>MS=Michael Schumacher, Ferrari</small><br>
<small>EI=Eddie Irvine, Ferrari</small><br>
<small>MH=Mika Häkkinen, McLaren-Mercedes</small><br>
<small>DC=David Coulthard, McLaren-Mercedes</small></font></strong></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Mika, to what extent can you treat a
championship-deciding race as a normal GP weekend?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">MH: Coming here, that is the intention we have set for
ourselves. But obviously it is not a normal race. Whatever experience I have gained during
my career in Formula 1, this is completely different. I am finding it very challenging. I
wouldn't say it is easy, but then none of the GPs in which I have competed this year has
been easy. I am looking forward to it and I am really happy to be here. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. You say you want to win, but you have also said that it
is not necessary to become champion. Have you made up your mind yet about what you really
want from this race?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">MH: It certainly depends on how Sunday's race develops. It's
unrealistic for me to sit here and say whether I am going to be second, third, first or
whatever. That decision is for Sunday. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Michael, last year we saw how much help you could get
from your team mate. What are you expecting from Eddie on Sunday?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">MS: Basically, for him to do as good a job as he has already
done at several races this year, and also during testing. That's not too much to ask,
because he can do a lot of things himself and he knows how to race. He also wants to do as
well as he can for himself. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. David, what is your plan to help Mika?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">DC: It all depends on the situation in the race. Clearly
everyone will be out to do his best in qualifying. But one thing is sure about Sunday: it
is going to be a hard, close race between McLaren and Ferrari. I think our McLaren will be
good round this circuit, and maybe it will all depend on differences between the tyres. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Eddie, to what extent can you help Michael?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">EI: That depends on where we each qualify, and where the
McLarens qualify. Even though we'll know all that on Saturday night, it could all change
at the first corner. Last year Michael and I were very lucky the way things worked out.
With him going slow, I was able to go round the outside of him, and that put things into
our hands. That's doesn't mean to say it will happen like that again. This time, if the
McLarens are one second a lap quicker and start from the front row of the grid, there
won't be much that Michael and I can do about it. We have to suss it as it happens. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Your emotions before the last race?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">MS: As of yet I don't feel it. The tension is not really
there yet, maybe it will change on Sunday. But it's pretty relaxed. </font></small></p>

<p><b><small><font face="Arial">Q. Mika, what are your feelings?</font></small></b></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">MH: I'm actually quite surprised how relaxed I am. For me it
is all new to be in the situation that I am. You just have to be very relaxed in your mind
and very focused in your work. There is no point in starting to think about the situation
too much, otherwise you will get nervous. You just have to concentrate on your driving and
your work with the team, and that's it. Maybe, like Michael said, the tension goes up on
Sunday. Not yet. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Michael, what have you been doing in the last five
weeks apart from testing? Have you been able to clear your mind of the championship?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">MS: I don't feel it's necessary to do anything special for
the situation except what we have done: going testing, doing your normal training
programme and leaving enough time to balance yourself, which I usually do at home with my
family. I played some football. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Eddie and David, where from a sporting view do you draw
the line in helping your teammate?</b> </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">DC: It's very difficult to try and give an answer to the
question because you don't know the situation [will be]. Every racing incident is
different. Everyone is going to have a different opinion ... </font></small></p>

<p><b><small><font face="Arial">MS: Are we going to have racing incidents?</font></small></b></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">DC: ... and therefore whether you drive somebody off the road
is always going to be down to a matter of opinion. From my side I have certainly said in
the past that I believe very much in what is the racing line. I also have my opinion on
certain things which other drivers will disagree on. But I'm not here to break the rules
as I read and understand them to help Mika win the championship. I have never done that
for my own championships in the past, so I don't see why I should do it for someone
else's. Equally, I won't make it as easy as Eddie did for Mika did to overtake at the
Nurburgring, if that was the situation. I would have put up a lot more of a fight than he
did there, because it would have benefited his teammate. </font></small></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">EI: I agree. If Mika is trying to overtake me, he's got to be
more careful than if he is overtaking somebody else, because I have nothing to lose. So I
can afford to take a bit more of a chance. It's the same for Michael with DC. The guy who
is fighting for the championship has a bit more to lose than the guy who is not fighting
for the championship. I wouldn't want to take Mika off -- or anybody else off for that
matter -- so that Michael could win the championship because I wouldn't want somebody to
do it to me. That's how you have to judge it.</font></small></p>
